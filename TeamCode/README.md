# TeamCode — external tooling

This module builds on the stock FTC SDK (`12.0.0`) with a small set of external
libraries. This doc records what's included, what was deliberately left out,
and why — so the reasoning survives past whoever added it.

> **History note.** An earlier version of this file documented a Pedro Pathing
> `2.1.2` stack and presented it as a considered choice. It wasn't — it was
> copied forward from the previous season's project before Pedro 3 shipped, and
> then never revisited. Pedro 3 is a re-architecture, not a version bump, so
> treat anything you remember from that doc as stale rather than as a decision
> someone made.

## Included

| Library | Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sloth | `dev.frozenmilk.sinister:Sloth:0.3.2` (+ `dev.frozenmilk:Load:0.3.2` Gradle plugin) | Fast dex scanning at OpMode discovery time — roughly 50% faster init than the SDK's plain reflective scan. Also the discovery mechanism AutoTune is built on (see below), so it is no longer optional. |
| Pedro Pathing (core) | `com.pedropathing:core:3.0.1` | Pathing, geometry and math. Pure Java — no Android or FTC SDK types. |
| Pedro Pathing (revhub) | `com.pedropathing:revhub:3.0.1` | The REV hardware layer: mecanum/swerve drivetrains, Pinpoint/OTOS/OctoQuad/dead-wheel localizers, hub IMU. Brings `core` transitively; `core` is still declared explicitly so its version is pinned in one place. |
| Pedro AutoTune | `com.pedropathing:tuning:1.0.1` | Robot-hosted tuning webpage. Backs the procedures in `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.pedro`. |
| Ivy | `com.pedropathing.ivy:pedro:1.1.1` | Command-based control flow (scheduler, `Command`/`CommandBuilder`, subsystem requirements/priority). Pedro Pathing's own command framework — used in place of NextFTC. |
| CachingHardware | `dev.frozenmilk.dairy:CachingHardware:1.0.0` | Wraps motor/servo writes to skip redundant `setPower`/`setPosition` calls when the new value is within tolerance of the cached one. |
| Panels | `com.bylazar.sloth:fullpanels:0.3.2+1.0.13` | Live dashboard: real-time tuning of constants, field/pose overlay, wireless Limelight pipeline tuning, telemetry graphs. Sloth-compatible build variant of `com.bylazar:fullpanels`. |
| FTC Dashboard | `com.acmerobotics.slothboard:dashboard:0.3.2+0.6.0` | Passive telemetry/field monitoring, run alongside Panels. Sloth-compatible build variant of `com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard`. Kept in case we resume AdvantageScope integration (it piggybacks on FTC Dashboard's packet stream). |

Limelight3A support (`com.qualcomm.hardware.limelightvision`) needs no separate
dependency — it ships as part of the SDK's `Hardware` artifact in
`build.dependencies.gradle`.

### No `maven.pedropathing.com`

Pedro 3.x publishes `core`, `revhub` and `tuning` to **Maven Central**, as does
Ivy. The `https://maven.pedropathing.com` repository entry that 2.x required is
gone from `TeamCode/build.gradle`; don't re-add it.

### Why the versions are locked together

Three constraints pin this stack. Bump any one of them and you have to move the
others in the same commit:

1. **AutoTune requires Sloth `0.3.2`.** `com.pedropathing:tuning` discovers
   `@Tuner`-annotated fields via `TunerScanner`, which is a Sinister `Scanner`
   — i.e. AutoTune does not work without the Sloth runtime.
2. **The Sloth-variant builds of Panels and FTC Dashboard are version-locked to
   the Sloth runtime**, which is what the `0.3.2+…` prefix in their version
   strings means. They must track the Sloth version, and `dev.frozenmilk:Load`
   (the Gradle plugin) must match it too.
3. **Panels `0.3.2+1.0.5` declares `androidx.appcompat:appcompat` as
   `{strictly 1.2.0}`.** That is why `build.dependencies.gradle` pins appcompat
   at `1.2.0` and not something newer. A Dependabot PR raising appcompat will
   fail to resolve — close it rather than trying to force the version, since
   `strictly` is Panels telling us it means it. `1.2.0` is also what the stock
   FTC SDK and the Pedro Quickstart both declare.

   **The `1.7.1` this replaced was not fixing anything** — checked, because a
   silent downgrade of something load-bearing would be a nasty surprise later.
   The trail: DECODE `5b9446e` (2026-05-16) raised it `1.2.0` → `1.7.1` as one
   bullet in a six-line bulk dependency refresh, no reason given, "not yet
   verified on robot"; this repo's `f71afce` then copied it across "to match",
   and the README that commit added — which documented everything else, down to
   libraries deliberately *not* included — never mentions appcompat at all.
   Nothing in either stack ever asked for it: `CachingHardware:1.0.0` and
   Panels `0.2.4+1.0.5` both declare appcompat **`1.2.0`**, as ordinary
   (non-strict) `requires`, so Gradle silently resolved them up to `1.7.1`
   because higher wins. Building `master` with appcompat forced to `1.2.0`
   succeeds. So there is no latent bug waiting to resurface: the downgrade
   restores the version two of our own dependencies were asking for.

One non-obvious consequence: `Load:0.3.2` pulls `com.android.tools.build:gradle`
transitively, so the `buildscript` block in `TeamCode/build.gradle` needs
`google()` in its repositories. `Load:0.2.4` did not.

## The `pedro` package

`TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/pedro/` is copied verbatim
from the official Pedro Pathing Quickstart at tag `v3.0.1`. It is upstream code,
not ours — when Pedro releases a new Quickstart, re-copy it rather than patching
it in place.

Two of those files are deliberately stubs upstream, and are where our robot
configuration goes. Both are now filled in; everything else in the package is
still untouched upstream code.

- **`Constants.java`** — holds `drivetrainConfig` (mecanum), `localizerConfig`
  (Pinpoint) and `foresightConfig`, plus the factory methods AutoTune needs.

  **The argument order in the old stub comment was wrong.** It suggested
  `new Follower(drivetrain, localizer, foresight)`; the real 3.0.1 signature is
  `Follower(Localizer, Drivetrain, Algorithm)` — localizer first. Upstream's own
  `procedures/Tests.java` builds it in the correct order, so the comment was the
  outlier, not the library.

- **`Tuning.java`** — registers the procedures that match our hardware.

  **`@Tuner` goes on a method, not a field.** The earlier wording here said
  "`@Tuner`-annotated fields", which does not work: the annotation is
  `@Target(METHOD)`, and `TunerScanner.scan` walks `getDeclaredMethods()`
  requiring each one to be **static, zero-argument, and to return `Procedure`**.
  It throws `IllegalArgumentException` otherwise — *"Method %s.%s is annotated
  with @Tuner, but is not static."* — during OpMode discovery, so a mistake here
  takes down robot startup rather than failing quietly.

**Nothing in this package registers an OpMode**, and that is still true now that
the stubs are filled in — there is not a single `@TeleOp` or `@Autonomous`
annotation in it. AutoTune creates its tuning OpModes at runtime from the
registered procedures; they never exist as annotated classes here.

### Our hardware, and what still needs measuring

| | |
|---|---|
| Drivetrain | Mecanum — `frontLeft`, `frontRight`, `backLeft`, `backRight` |
| Localizer | goBILDA Pinpoint (`pinpoint`), goBILDA 4-bar odometry pods |

Three groups of values in `Constants.java` are **placeholders that AutoTune
replaces**, and the robot will not drive correctly until it has:

1. Motor directions — currently the conventional left-reversed guess.
2. Pinpoint pod directions and X/Y offsets — currently `FORWARD` and `0.0`.
   Zero offsets treat the pods as sitting on the tracking centre, so heading
   changes corrupt the position estimate.
3. All of `foresightConfig` — currently empty, see below.

Run the tuners in this order; each produces the values the next one needs.
**Mecanum Tuner → Pinpoint Tuner → Foresight Tuner → Tests.** Each ends on a page
of generated Java to paste over the matching block in `Constants.java`.

### Foresight cannot be configured off the robot

`foresightConfig` is intentionally an empty lambda. Twelve of `ForesightConfig`'s
variables are declared `ConfigVar.required(…)` with **no default** —
`headingFeedback`, `forwardTranslational`, `strafeTranslational`, `brake`,
`coast`, the linear/quadratic/heading brake coefficients, both
`maxAchievable*Velocity` and both `natural*Deceleration`. Reading an unset one
throws `IllegalStateException("Config variable has not been set")`.

Those twelve are exactly what the Foresight Tuner measures. There is no
"defaults for now" option and nothing here should be guessed: they are
properties of this robot's mass, wheels and battery. `Constants.createAlgorithm()`
probes one of them and fails at init with a message naming the fix, because the
bare library error surfaces partway through following a path with no field name
and no hint.

The drivetrain and localizer configs are complete, so the Mecanum, Pinpoint and
Foresight tuners all run today, as do the Tests procedure's localization,
odometry, pose and driving tests. Only its hold, line and curve tests need a
tuned Foresight, since only those build a `Follower`.

## Deliberately excluded

- **NextFTC** — the previous command framework. Migrated off it onto Ivy;
  reintroducing it would mean maintaining two overlapping command schedulers.
- **`com.pedropathing:telemetry`** — only existed as a crutch for one
  unmigrated file in the source project this was based on. Don't carry it
  forward; if a file needs it, port that file to the current telemetry API
  instead of re-adding the dependency. (It still exists on Maven Central at
  `1.0.0` and was never updated for Pedro 3.)
- **Road Runner / `maven.brott.dev`** — not in use; the maven repo isn't
  declared here to avoid an unused, unexplained entry.
- **AdvantageScope Lite** — not currently wired in. Add it back only if that
  debugging workflow is actually resumed.
- **Marrow** (`io.github.skeleton-army.marrow`) — a newer reactive-behavior
  library that layers on NextFTC/FTCLib/SolversLib. No evidence yet of use by
  competitive teams; worth revisiting, not a default include.
- **`exportPaths` Gradle task** — a nice-to-have that exports autonomous
  paths as `.pp` files for the Pedro Pathing visualizer. Not added here
  because it depends on a `util.ExportAutoPaths` utility class that doesn't
  exist in this project yet. Add both together when autonomous path code
  exists to export.

## SDK 12.0 compatibility notes

The SDK moved 11.2.1 → 12.0 alongside the Pedro 3 migration. Pedro's `revhub`
artifact is itself compiled (`compileOnly`) against `org.firstinspires.ftc:*`
**12.0.0**, so this keeps us on the SDK combination Pedro is built and tested
against.

- **The one breaking SDK change is AprilTag clusters.** SDK 12 splits
  `AprilTagDetection` into `AprilTagSingleDetection` and
  `AprilTagClusterDetection`; code that iterates detections and reads `.id`,
  `.metadata` or `.center` directly no longer compiles. Six stock samples in
  `FtcRobotController/` were affected and were replaced with the official v12.0
  versions. The `FtcRobotController` module is now byte-identical to the stock
  v12.0 module, so it can be refreshed wholesale on the next SDK bump — we carry
  no local patches in it. **This will bite us again** the first time we write
  vision code: see https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/apriltag-clusters.
- Also worth knowing: BIOBUZZ AprilTags move, so per the SDK release notes they
  are **not suitable for absolute field localization**. Don't plan a localizer
  around them.
- **Sloth** is a Gradle plugin as well as a runtime library, so it's the
  dependency most exposed to build-tooling bumps. The project is on Gradle 9.5.1
  + AGP 8.13.2, which requires Android Studio Narwhal 3 Feature Drop or later to
  sync at all.
- **Panels and FTC Dashboard each moved a minor version** (1.0.12 → 1.0.13 and
  0.5.1 → 0.6.0) as part of the Sloth 0.3.2 lock. They compile, but no one has
  run them against a real robot on this stack yet — do a deploy-and-smoke-test
  before relying on either mid-season.
- **CachingHardware** is a plain runtime library, unchanged, and its source repo
  has had no commits in some time. No reported breakage, no explicit
  re-validation either.
